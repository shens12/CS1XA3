This is a bash script to keep at root of your git repo that performs some specific functionalities.

By reading through this README, you can also get a quickly understanding of all functions.

## My Features

Two additional personal features are provided in this script.

### Feature 1 : show_newest

To Display The Last Updated File Or The Newest File In A Directory.

### Feature 2 : user_info 

To Get The Current Date, Time, Username And Current Working Directory.

### Feature 3 : Option to view created file

## Acknowledgments and References

### Option to view created file
#### get intuition from
##### https://github.com/longz3 
When user runs his bash script, an option to view created files is provided. I think this is pretty good and convenient because in this way you don't need to change directory to get to the new file.

### Explanation functionality
#### get intuition from
##### ssh "man" command
When we did Quiz1 (playing that game with ssh commands), we could use "man" command to ask the wise "man" on how to use certain command or get explanations. Inspired by this, I write "explanation" functionality.
